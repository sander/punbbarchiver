PunBBArchiver is a set of PHP and Python scripts. When it's finished, it will be able to provide PunBB forum users with a plain text archive of a forum. A reason for forum administrators to use this, might be that their users don't have to be afraid to loose their contributions.

It is not under active maintenance. Please send me an email (sander.dijkhuis@gmail.com) if you're interested in continuing development.
